# Code Example: Filter Values

This subdirectory contains example code for filtering values out of a dataset (in this case, removing pixels where aboveground live carbon density is equal to zero in Planet's Forest Carbon Diligence dataset). The code also demonstrates how to plot these results against the raw (unfiltered) data to visualize the impact of the filtering.

The example code is included in a Jupyter Notebook (`filter-values.ipynb`).
