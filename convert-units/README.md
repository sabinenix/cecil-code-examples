# Code Example: Convert Units

This subdirectory contains example code for converting units (in this case, from Planet's aboveground carbon density to aboveground biomass) and renaming columns using SQL. The code also demonstrates how to pull this new data into a pandas dataframe.

The example code is included in a Jupyter Notebook (`convert-units.ipynb`).

## Requirements

The requirements for this code example are included in the `requirements.txt` file.
