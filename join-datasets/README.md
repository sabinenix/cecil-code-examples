# Code Example: Join Datasets

This subdirectory contains example code for joining variables from two distinct datasets and returning a single
combined dataset. In this example, we access aboveground biomass data from Chloris, and aboveground carbon density and canopy cover data from Planet. We rename these variables, and join them into a single dataset using SQL. This example code
introduces the concept of using SQL aliases to refer to separate datasets, and demonstrates how to perform an outer join.

The example code is included in a Jupyter Notebook (`join-datasets.ipynb`).
