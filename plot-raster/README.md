# Code Example: Plotting a Raster Map

This subdirectory contains example code for plotting data extracted from the Snowflake database as raster data using three different methods:

1. **Plotting directly from Pandas** – Basic raster data plotting using `pandas` and its integrated plotting capabilities.
2. **Plotting using Xarray** – Raster data plotting using `xarray` with its direct plotting functionality and combined with `matplotlib`.
3. **Plotting using Cartopy on top of a basemap** – Plotting raster data using `cartopy` for geospatial visualization over a basemap.

The example code is included in a Jupyter Notebook (`plot-raster.ipynb`).

## Requirements

The requirements for this code example are included in the `requirements.txt` file.
