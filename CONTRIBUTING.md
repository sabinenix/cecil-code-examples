# Contributing

Create a subdirectory for each code example containing:

- all files required e.g. python scripts, `requirements.txt` etc.
- a `README.md` file providing as much detail as possible.
- a `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing output files.

Update the top-level `README.md` file with a brief description following the standard from other code examples.

*Do not include sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials.*
