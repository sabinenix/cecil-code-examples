## Plot Raster Map

This code example outlines different ways to plot data for one variable and one year in a raster map format. 
The following three methods are demonstrated: 
1. Plotting directly from a pandas dataframe
2. Plotting from xarray (directly and via matplotlib)
3. Plotting on a basemap using cartopy.
